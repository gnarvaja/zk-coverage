# Price Lists

This directory was generated with the scripts in the `hurdat2` directory. In the future it would be good to 
leave these files out of the repository and generate them in a GitHub Workflow or something like that.

We have a single price list:
- pricerlist.html: a HTML map with the loss probability for each area.
- pricerlist.json: a JSON file with the loss probabilities for each area.
- pricerlist-sign.json: a JSON file with the merkle root, the valid dates and the signature of all that information by
                        an authorized account. (TO DO)
